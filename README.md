# Visualizing Complex Exponential Signals

Combing sinusoids of different frequencies are not trivial. However, using Euler's formula:

``e^{j*Θ} = \cos( Θ) + j\sin( Θ)``

where:
- Θ represents the angle in radians,
- j represents the imaginary unit,
- cos(Θ) represents the Real part,
- jsin(Θ) represents the Imaginary part.

Theta can be represented as a sum of a rotation elements and a phase element:
`` Θ = ω*t + ɸ ``

where:
- ω represents the angular frequency in radians/second, and determines the pace of the rotation
- t represents time in seconds,
- ɸ represents the phase shift of the signal

Using this knowledge, 
This formula allows us to represent complex exponential signals in terms of sine and cosine functions as projections on the real and imaginary axes vs time.
